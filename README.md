"run" Delete mutex manually, probably useless.  

"log" Will enable some additional info being shown.  

"afk" Cycles betweens clients, you still have to use an autoclicker though.  

Windows smartscreen will probably warn you because the program looks at all running processes to find Roblox clients.
